# Introduction

Julia is a high-level and general-purpose language that can be used to write code that is fast to execute and easy to implement for scientific calculations. The language is designed to keep all the needs of scientific researchers and data scientists to optimize the experimentation and design implementation. [Julia (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)).

## Overview

In this article, I will be discussing the advantages of Julia language and I will display how it’s easy to use DataFrame.jl, just like pandas in python. I will use simple examples and a few lines of code to demonstrate data manipulation and data visualization. We will be using the famous [Heart Disease UCI | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) Dataset which has a binary classification of Heart Disease based on multiple factors.
